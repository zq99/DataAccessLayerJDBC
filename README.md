# Java Data Access Layer (DAL) for SQL Server

This project is a an experiment to create a Data Access Layer to handle database operations in java project.

The project has its own object model to retrieve data, so it converts to the ResultSet object to a custom DataTable object.

This DataTable object can then be used in applications, without having to persist a connection with the database or use the data immediately whilst a connection is open.
